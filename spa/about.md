# Hello.

<p style="font-weight: 500; font-size: 2.2em">My name is Leo King.</p>

I'm a .NET programmer who is interested in C, Go, Rust and JavaScript. I like to contribute open source, so you can find me in [GitHub](https://github.com/tatwd).

I usually use `_king` as my nickname. If you happen to speak Chinese, you can call me 金成龙 (jīn chéng lóng).
<!--  You can also find me on [知乎](https://zhihu.com). -->
<!-- Sometimes, I write [blog](https://tatwd.github.io/blog/). -->

Outside of programming, I enjoy reading, watching and writing my [blog](https://blog.cloong.me/).
